    "With the rise of online social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, and the proliferation of customer reviews on sites like Amazon and Yelp, we now have access, more than ever before, to massive text-based data sets! They can be analyzed in order to determine how large portions of the population feel about certain products, events, etc. This sort of analysis is called _sentiment analysis_. In this notebook you will build an end-to-end sentiment classification system from scratch.\n",

    "Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '**TODO**' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `# TODO: ...` comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '**Question:**' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '**Answer:**' header by editing the Markdown cell.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Then, you may want to deploy your model as a mobile app or web service. What do you need to do in order to package your model for such deployment? How would you accept a new review, convert it into a form suitable for your model, and perform the actual prediction? (Note that the same environment you used during training may not be available.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- One simplification we made in this notebook is to limit the task to binary classification. The dataset actually includes a more fine-grained review rating that is indicated in each review's filename (which is of the form `<[id]_[rating].txt>` where `[id]` is a unique identifier and `[rating]` is on a scale of 1-10; note that neutral reviews > 4 or < 7 have been excluded). How would you modify the notebook to perform regression on the review ratings? In what situations is regression more useful than classification, and vice-versa?\n",
